# Online Portfolio - Edward Payne

## Description

The purpose of this project was to desing and build an online portfolio to showcase my past and current design projects. During this process I feel I've cemented the importance of not only making your application accesible to all that use the internet as well as making any application responsive so that it performs well across multiple different devices.
